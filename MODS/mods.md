## Rules: 

### For Mods: 
- branch and check out main codebase
- create a folder withing /MODS/ using your GIT username. IE: /MODS/myUserName/
- keep the root folder structure 
- make your mods/edits/changes/contributions

### For updates to the core (fixes, QOL): 

- ONLY if you want to have a feature pulled into MAIN:
  - post a PR (pull request) for a branch 
  - only include the changes you are recommending that fix a base feature 
  - have VERY detailed GIT check in comments - this will make or break your request!!!!

### OVERALL: 
- be patient, we are a small team. wait for approval and validation. 
- In some cases, mods will be merged back to the main project and you may be invited as a contributor.
