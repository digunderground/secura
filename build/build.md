# PRINT - Print details
###########################################################################
## Secura Chassis:

- SLM: Any files with "ISO" in the file name should be printed in PLASTIC, they are isolation parts. DO NOT print in metal.
- FDM/SLA you will need to merge the "CH-ISO_Battery.stl" into the main chassis
- FDM/SLA OPTIONAL: you can merge the proffie to the chassis

## Secura Crystal Chamber:

- SPG-window needs to be printed in CLEAR RESIN or other clear material

## Secura Speaker:

- SP files with "holder" in the name need to be printed in CLEAR RESIN if you want to see the lights 

## Should you choose to print this using FDM or SLA or SLS, see the notes below:
For FDM:

- the finished product WILL lack strength in the layer direction
- you WILL lose some of the detail
- we recommend tree supports where necessarry
- you will need to merge some parts into one (positive terminal isolation) and potentially use alternate parts
- you will lose the chassis being a common ground

For SLA:

- we recommend a 50/50 mixture of Siraya Tech Tenacious Flex and an "ABS Like Resin" - SUNLU works well
- SLA is weaker than most FDM, but has unidirectional strength
- you will need to merge some parts into one (positive terminal isolation) and potentially use alternate parts
- you will lose the chassis being a common ground

For SLS:

- we recommend this over SLA and FDM, but still inferior to metal
- you will need to merge some parts into one (positive terminal isolation) and potentially use alternate parts
- this is the best budget option if metal is not an option for you.
- you will lose the chassis being a common ground
