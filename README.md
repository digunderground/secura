# Secura - Graflex Lightsaber Chassis - RELEASE
###########################################################################

PLEASE READ ANY/ALL .MD FILES BEFORE WASTING $$ ON PRINTS YOU DONT NEED
we are working on updates to these .MD files 

###########################################################################
##  KNOWN ISSUES - This is a WIP!!! 
###########################################################################

- the 33mm speaker (Shtok titan) requires quite a bit of thinning for the enclosure. This likely CANNOT be printed via FDM/SLA/SLS and needs to be done via SLM + nail-biting sanding.
- for FDM/SLA/SLS: you will need to merge the main battery chassis and positive (top) isolation terminal as a single print

### The intention is to print this in SLM metal using services like:
- 316L best price: https://jlc3dp.com/
- Aluminium and other metals: https://craftcloud3d.com/

### Laser Cut metal parts have been tested from:
- https://sendcutsend.com/

### Should you choose to print this using FDM or SLA or SLS, see the notes below: 
For FDM:
- the finished product WILL lack strength in the layer direction
- you WILL lose some of the detail
- we recommend tree supports where necessarry
- you will need to merge some parts into one (positive terminal isolation) and potentially use alternate parts
- you will lose the chassis being a common ground 

For SLA:
- we recommend a 50/50 mixture of Siraya Tech Tenacious Flex and an "ABS Like Resin" - SUNLU works well
- SLA is weaker than most FDM, but has unidirectional strength
- you will need to merge some parts into one (positive terminal isolation) and potentially use alternate parts
- you will lose the chassis being a common ground 

For SLS:
- we recommend this over SLA and FDM, but still inferior to metal
- you will need to merge some parts into one (positive terminal isolation) and potentially use alternate parts
- this is the best budget option if metal is not an option for you.
- you will lose the chassis being a common ground
